[FIXED] Syncthing camera sync permissions
- Solution: See PATHS_GUIDE.md for complete path mappings
- Use /data/camera-sync/android in Syncthing UI (maps to /mnt/storage/syncthing/camera-sync/android)
- Folders created with correct permissions by init-storage.sh

[FIXED] Volume mappings documentation
- Solution: See PATHS_GUIDE.md for all service path mappings
- Syncthing: /data/* → /mnt/storage/syncthing/*
- Kopia: /data/* → various folders (read-only)
- FileBrowser: /srv/storage/* and /srv/cachehdd/*

[FIXED] Vaultwarden configuration
- Solution: See VAULTWARDEN_SETUP.md
- Memory increased to 128M, healthcheck timeout increased
- Android app: Server URL = http://192.168.178.40:8080 (no cert needed)

[FIXED] Porn folder created
- Solution: Added to /mnt/storage/syncthing/Privates/porn
- Modified init-storage.sh to create folder automatically

[FIXED] OneDrive migration solution
- Solution: See onedrive-migration.sh script
- Automated migration with rsync, preserves everything
- Archive at /mnt/storage/syncthing/OneDrive-Archive

[FIXED] Soulseek symlinks
- Solution: See setup-soulseek-symlinks.sh script
- Symlinks: music, books, audiobooks, podcasts → /mnt/storage/slskd-shared/

[WONTFIX] Filebrowser shows capacity of storage and cachehdd wrong
- Reason: Docker bind mount limitation. FileBrowser reports the capacity of the container's root filesystem (overlay) when the root is set to a directory containing mountpoints. The capacity of the actual drives will be visible when navigating inside the respective folders, but the global usage bar may be incorrect.

[NOTE] Homepage Gluetun Widget "Invalid data"
- Analysis: This error occurs when Gluetun has not yet established a VPN connection or fetched the public IP. It returns an empty IP string, which fails the Homepage widget validation. This is expected behavior during startup and should resolve once the VPN connects.

[FIXED] OOM (Out of Memory) errors
- Solution: See OOM_FIX.md for complete analysis
- Added 128M memory limit to storage-init container (was unlimited)
- **AUTOMATIC SWAP**: 2GB swap now auto-created on cache HDD every startup!
- Process: apk installing openssl in storage-init was hitting cgroup limits
- Swap location: /mnt/cachehdd/swapfile (2GB, automatically enabled)
- Modified docker-compose.yml: added memory limits + SYS_ADMIN capability
- Modified init-storage.sh: automatic swap creation, initialization, enablement
