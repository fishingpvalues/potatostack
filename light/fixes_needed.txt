[WONTFIX] Filebrowser shows capacity of storage and cachehdd wrong
- Reason: Docker bind mount limitation. FileBrowser reports the capacity of the container's root filesystem (overlay) when the root is set to a directory containing mountpoints. The capacity of the actual drives will be visible when navigating inside the respective folders, but the global usage bar may be incorrect.

[NOTE] Homepage Gluetun Widget "Invalid data"
- Analysis: This error occurs when Gluetun has not yet established a VPN connection or fetched the public IP. It returns an empty IP string, which fails the Homepage widget validation. This is expected behavior during startup and should resolve once the VPN connects.
