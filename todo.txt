- for vscode host mcp serbvers: kill all vscoed server instance processes
- unpackerr has been sloppy integrated let it pick up all files and folders which are archives and have been there before it started and integrate fully: ❯ i have to deflate the downloads of any servie of my stack what will be the best service for this SOTA? Extracting to folder inplace, when stack crashes  
  stopping and resume, lightweight, low HDD IO, low cpu, crash save hardened etc and afterwards when its finished del of original it should always extract 
   to foldername based on the archive inplace should watch ALL DL folders use Unpackerr integrate fully give all ownership etc add to all scripts          
  necessray   
- add and fully integrate freqtrade
search plan execute the github docs for both
add Ghostfolio as well and fully integrate i want to use csv import of my financiial data

- STASH AND POSTGRES ON SSD NOT HDD PLS FIX [DONE - both already on /mnt/ssd/docker-data/ = /dev/sda2 internal SSD]
- stack doesnt start fix it [DONE - ghost container 1465f0c2ea5c (filestash) corrupted Docker state, removed + restarted]

implement with my PostgreSQL (increase resources if necessary):

### Recommended SOTA Lightweight Self-Hosted Calendar Service: Baïkal

Based on your PotatoStack setup (a resource-constrained Mini PC with 16GB RAM, Postgres/Redis backend, and focus on lightweight, Dockerized services), the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight calendar solution as of early 2026 is **Baïkal**. It's a minimal CalDAV/CardDAV server specifically designed for calendars and contacts, emphasizing simplicity, low resource use, and standards compliance. It outperforms heavier alternatives like Nextcloud (which would bloat your stack) while providing enough management tools to handle imports and integrations without needing a full cloud suite.

#### Why Baïkal Fits Your Needs
- **Lightweight & Efficient**: 
  - Runs on ~50-100MB RAM and <0.1 CPU core under light load—ideal for your 16GB setup alongside Jellyfin, Prometheus, etc.
  - PHP-based (no heavy JS frameworks), with SQLite default (or Postgres for scalability). No Redis/Mongo dependency, but it plays nice with your existing Postgres if you want multi-DB sharing.
  - Docker image is tiny (~150MB), deploys in seconds, and scales to single-user/multi-calendar use without overhead.

- **Self-Hosting Ease**:
  - Official Docker support via `ckulka/baikal` (or community forks like `docker-baikaldav/baikal` for latest features).
  - No complex config: Basic setup in <5 minutes. Supports HTTPS via your Tailscale/GlueTun setup.

- **Importing Calendars from Google**:
  - Export your Google Calendars as ICS files (via Google Calendar settings > Export > .ics per calendar).
  - Use Baïkal's web admin UI to create user accounts and calendars, then import ICS via a CalDAV client (e.g., Thunderbird desktop or DAVx⁵ on Android/iOS). Once synced, all events/tasks/contacts migrate seamlessly.
  - Post-import: Unsubscribe from Google ICS feeds in clients and delete the Google data—your self-hosted copy is now primary. Baïkal handles recurring events, alarms, and attachments without loss.

- **Integration with Apps/Services ("All Apps")**:
  - Full **CalDAV** (calendars/tasks) and **CardDAV** (contacts) support— the open standard used by 99% of calendar apps.
  - Works out-of-the-box with:
    - **Mobile**: DAVx⁵ (Android), iOS/macOS built-in, Outlook mobile.
    - **Desktop**: Thunderbird, Evolution, Apple Calendar.
    - **Web**: Pair with InfCloud (lightweight open-source web client, ~20MB RAM) for browser access without a native app.
    - **Your Stack**: Syncs with Home Assistant (via CalDAV integration), n8n workflows, or even Miniflux for event-based RSS. Expose via Tailscale for secure remote access.
  - No vendor lock-in: Events sync bidirectionally across devices/services.

- **SOTA Status (2026)**:
  - Actively maintained (v0.9.x+ with 2025/2026 updates for better WebDAV compatibility and OIDC auth hooks).
  - Tops "lightweight CalDAV" lists on Awesome Selfhosted and Reddit (e.g., r/selfhosted threads praise it over Radicale for admin UI without bloat).
  - Edges out competitors:
    - **Radicale**: Lighter (Python, no DB), but no web UI—pure backend.
    - **Xandikos**: Ultra-minimal, but lacks multi-user/UI.
    - **DAViCal**: Similar PHP base, but heavier admin and less active.
    - **OxiCloud**: Promising 2025 newcomer for DAV sync, but still maturing (no dedicated calendar UI; more file-focused).
    - Avoid Nextcloud: Too resource-heavy (~1GB+ RAM) for your "lightweight" ask.

- **Pros/Cons**:
  | Aspect | Pro | Con |
  |--------|-----|-----|
  | **Performance** | Sub-100ms syncs; handles 10k+ events on SQLite. | Scales best for 1-5 users (fine for personal/family). |
  | **Security** | Built-in HTTP auth; easy HTTPS via Traefik/Tailscale. | No advanced RBAC (use your Vaultwarden for 2FA). |
  | **Features** | Multi-calendar support, sharing, ICS import/export. | Event editing via clients (not full web editor—use InfCloud for that). |
  | **Maintenance** | Zero-downtime updates; auto-backup via Velld/Backrest. | PHP deps (but Docker isolates this). |

#### Docker Compose Integration for Your PotatoStack
Add this to your `docker-compose.yml` under `services:` (after the CORE DATABASES section). It uses SQLite for max lightness but can switch to your Postgres. Expose via Tailscale (port 8080) for secure access.

- **Env Vars**: Add to your `.env`:
  ```
  BAIKAL_ADMIN_USER=yourusername
  BAIKAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=strongpass123
  ```
- **Setup Steps**:
  1. `docker compose up -d baikal infcloud`
  2. Access admin UI: `https://your-tailscale-ip:8080/admin` (login with env creds).
  3. Create a user/calendar in UI.
  4. Export ICS from Google > Import via client (e.g., Thunderbird: File > Import > ICS).
  5. Configure clients: CalDAV URL = `https://your-tailscale-ip:8080/dav.php/calendars/username/calendarname/`
  6. Test sync, then nuke Google data.
- **Backup**: Auto-included in Velld/Backrest (mount `/mnt/ssd/docker-data/baikal`).
- **Monitoring**: Add to Grafana/Prometheus via labels; alerts on sync failures via ntfy.

This keeps your stack lean while ditching Google entirely. If you need more UI polish (e.g., drag-and-drop), pair with Morgen client (CalDAV-compatible, free tier). Questions on tweaks? Let me know!
