- for vscode host mcp serbvers: kill all vscoed server instance processes
- unpackerr has been sloppy integrated let it pick up all files and folders which are archives and have been there before it started and integrate fully: ❯ i have to deflate the downloads of any servie of my stack what will be the best service for this SOTA? Extracting to folder inplace, when stack crashes  
  stopping and resume, lightweight, low HDD IO, low cpu, crash save hardened etc and afterwards when its finished del of original it should always extract 
   to foldername based on the archive inplace should watch ALL DL folders use Unpackerr integrate fully give all ownership etc add to all scripts          
  necessray
